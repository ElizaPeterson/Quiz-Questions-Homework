1. Polymorphism means many shaped.

2. It is when objects from different classes can use a single method to achieve different responses. For example, a vehicle super class can take in a interface called IDrive where it has a drive() method. Then multiple different types of vehicles can extend vehicle and use that drive() method to return different strings.

3. Interfaces is one way you can implement polymorphism in Java, also inheritance.

4. It can only take as many forms as there are objects.

5. You can use polymorphism when many objects share a similar method.

6. Composition is when an object is created using smaller more simple objects.

7. You would use composition when you have a complex object, such as a vehicle being instatiated by smaller components, such as the engine, and tyres.

8. Composition is when a complex object directly inherents smaller objects through inheretance, where as aggregation is when using an interface to allow a many simpler objects to implement the same method, which is then used within a more complex object.

9. By using aggregation, its more complicated to setup, however once it is setup, it is much simpler to reuse the method. By composition, things are more strictly coupled, but its simpler to setup.

10. When using composition, when an object is destroyed, all the objects its composed of are also destroyed.

11. When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, only that object is destroyed.
